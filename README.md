Internship Tasks. 
Hello Connections, ðŸ‘‹here's my internship experience!

During my time at Oasis Infobyte, I had the pleasure of completing three tasks that were both challenging and rewarding. As someone who was actively seeking internships, I was thrilled to be selected for this opportunity.

The first task I was assigned was to create a landing page.
I named my landing page " *Balaji Residencies!* " and included several key features such as navigation, carousel, and cards. Thistask required me to use my design skills and thinkcritically about user experience. I enjoyed the process ofcreating this landing page, and I was proud of the final
result.

The second task was to create a portfolio website. For this task, I decided to create my own portfolio website. This allowed me to showcase my work and skills while also practicing my web development skills. I found this task to be challenging, but ultimately very rewarding. I was able to create a website that accurately reflected my skills and experiences.

The final task was to create a temperature converter. This task required me to think logically and use my programming skills. I created a converter that could convert from three different temperature measurements: Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.I enjoyed working on this task because it allowed me to use my knowledge of programming to create a practical solution.
